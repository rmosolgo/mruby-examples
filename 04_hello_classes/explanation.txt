this one took me a while to get it.

Until now, we have been able to,
- Call ruby code from C
- Call compiled ruby code from C

basically, all the ruby code were complete.
If you try to run the ruby code here, you'll get error.
Becuase, nowhere in the ruby file, the "fish" class has been definded.

But if you look into C code "hello_classes.c" you'll see
there are functions for "init" and "swim". But these are functions.
Not class. C is not a OOP.

If you continue reading, you'll see that on line 34

mrb_define_method(mrb, fish_class, "initialize", fish_init, MRB_ARGS_REQ(1));
  mrb_define_method(mrb, fish_class, "swim!", fish_swim, MRB_ARGS_REQ(1));

This is binding our functions to ruby objects. 

[All I can say at this point is that, it works. but I'm not sure how.]
