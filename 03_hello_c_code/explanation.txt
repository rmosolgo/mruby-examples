Here,
You have normal ruby code. "hello_c_code_ruby.rb"
You can run it by, "ruby hello_c_code_ruby.rb"
it'll print some line. 

What you can do is, compile the ruby code as a byte code. 
and run it using mruby as the previous example.

This time however, we are going to invoke it from a c code.
If you look into the makefile include with this repo,
you will find,
mruby/bin/mrbc -B hello_c_code_ruby $(03_DIR)/hello_c_code_ruby.rb
this command will generate hellow_c_code_ruby.c from hello_c_code_ruby.rb
So basically this commmand translates all your ruby code into bytescode which is accesible by c code. 

Now using a main file "hello_c_code.c" you simply use the mruby header files
to execute this bytecode. 

In short, what this example showed your is how to,

From ruby code >> to bytecode >> to C header code >> to C main code.
In the end, your code is running as a C code. not ruby.
